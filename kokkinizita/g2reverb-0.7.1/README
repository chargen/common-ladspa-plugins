Version 0.7.1 -- 9/3/2014
--------------------------------------------

* Plugin file renamed to g2reverb.so, compatible
  with older versions.

* Removed the two zita-reverbs of version 0.6.1.
  which are now in a separate package.


--------------------------------------------
Version 0.6.1 -- 28/8/2013
--------------------------------------------

* Plugin file renamed to zita-reverbs.so.
  Any older versions in /usr/lib/ladspa must be
  deleted to avoid conflicts.

* Cleanup of the 10 year old original code.

* Added

  # 3701  zita-reverb
  # 3702  zita-reverb-amb 

These are LADSPA versions of zita-rev1 in resp. stereo
and first order Ambisonic mode.

Note: some of the defaults may seem strange when used in
Ardour. The reason is that Ardour (3.3 at the time of writing)
doesn't handle defaults correctly for ports which have the
LOGARITHMIC hint set (the mouse wheel behaves strangely as
well on those).

Controls of the two zita-reverb plugins
---------------------------------------

Reverb controls:

* Delay    :  Initial delay, in seconds.
* Xover    :  Crossover frequency between RT-low and RT-mid.
* RT-low   :  Reverb time (RT60) at low frequencies.
* RT-mid   :  Reverb time (RT60) at medium frequencies.
* Damping  :  The frequency at which the reverb time
              becomes half the RT-mid value.

There are two parametric filters which act on the 'wet'
signal only:

* F1-freq  :  Center frequency of first filter.
* F1-gain  :  Gain of first filter.
* F2-freq  :  Center frequency of second filter.  
* F2-gain  :  Gain of second filter.

Bandwidth is constant, and somewhat higher than average.
Near the extreme frequency settings you get something very
close to a shelf filter.

Output controls:

* Output mix (Stereo version)  : Balance between dry sound and reverb.

* XYZ gain (Ambisonic version) : Relative gain of the first order
                                 outputs. The default is correct for SN3D.
                                 For 'FuMa' this should be set to +3 dB.

The Ambisonic version never outputs the dry sound, it must be
used as a send/return reverb, not as an insert.


--------------------------------------------
Version 0.3.1
--------------------------------------------

Added code to reset all audio upon deactivate(). Parameters
are preserved across deactivate()/activate().

Many thanks to Chris Cannam for pointing out the problem and
for providing patches to solve it.


--------------------------------------------
g2reverb.so  -- First release - 22/8/2003
--------------------------------------------

This reverb is based on gverb by Juhana Sadeharju, but the code
(now C++) is entirely original. I added a second input for stereo
operation, and some code to prevent FP denormalisation.
This is a preliminary release, and this plugin will probably change
a lot in future versions.
